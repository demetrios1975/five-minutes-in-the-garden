## Tuesday Transformation

# From Borders to Bridges

Christ does not simply invite us to be kind. He gently leads us to turn our borders into bridges.

In Matthew 25, Jesus says something both simple and profound:

> “I was a stranger, and you welcomed Me.” — Matthew 25:35

Lent is a season of returning.

We slow down.  
We pray more deliberately.  
We notice the places in our hearts that need attention.

And as we walk these forty days, one quiet question begins to surface:

Where have I grown guarded?

## The Internal Shift

Lent invites small, steady transformation. Not dramatic gestures — but faithful steps.

### Recognition over Fear

Sometimes we hesitate because we do not know what to expect. Yet Christ often comes to us in ordinary, unexpected ways — in the unfamiliar face, the overlooked conversation, the person standing just outside our comfort.

To recognize Him there is the beginning of transformation.

### Belonging over Exclusion

To say “you belong” may not change the world overnight. But it changes a moment.

And moments are where grace works.

### Grace as Refuge

Our homes, our churches, even our conversations can become places of refuge.

Hospitality is not performance.  
It is simply making room.

This is not about being naïve or reckless. It is about allowing our hearts to remain open. It is about remembering that we, too, have been welcomed by mercy.

## Today’s Challenge

Where might Christ be waiting — in someone you have overlooked?

Where might you be invited to move one step closer instead of pulling back?

Choose one small opportunity this week to turn a boundary into a bridge.

A word of welcome.  
A listening ear.  
A simple act of presence.

Christ crossed the greatest distance to reach us.

In welcoming others, we begin to understand what grace has done for us.
