## Scripture Reading  
**Luke 15:8–10**

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> “Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!’

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

## Devotional Reflection

The parables of Luke 15 are not only about wandering sons or stray sheep. They are about the heart of God.

Notice the verbs:  
She lights a lamp.  
She sweeps the house.  
She searches carefully.  
She does not stop until she finds.

This is not passive grace. This is active, determined love.

Perhaps you haven’t run away in rebellion. Perhaps you’ve simply grown quiet. Numb. Overlooked. Buried beneath dust and distraction.

Even there, the light is lit.

You are not forgotten. You are not disposable. You are not one among many.

He searches for the one.

And when you are found, heaven does not sigh with relief—it rejoices.

## Closing Prayer

*Heavenly Father,  
Thank You for searching for me when I didn’t even know I was missing.  
Shine the light of Your Spirit into the corners of my heart.  
Sweep away the clutter and distractions that have pushed me away.  
Help me to trust in Your persistence and rejoice in Your grace.  
May I never think I am too small to matter to You.  
In Jesus’ name,  
Amen.*
