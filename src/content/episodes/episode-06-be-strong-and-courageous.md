## Scripture Reading

Joshua 1:1–9 (KJV)

<sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,

<sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.

<sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

<sup class="verse-num">4</sup> From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates... shall be your coast.

<sup class="verse-num">5</sup> There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.

<sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law... turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night... for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.

## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father,


We come before You with grateful hearts, thanking You for the truth found in Your Word. As we reflect on the commissioning of Joshua, we are reminded of Your faithfulness and the assurance that You are always with us. Just as You called Joshua to be strong and courageous, we ask that You instill in us the same spirit of courage as we face the challenges and transitions in our own lives.

Lord, help us to meditate on Your Word day and night, that we may find guidance and strength in Your commands. May we be diligent in seeking Your will and living according to Your ways, trusting that You will lead us to the paths of prosperity and success that align with Your purpose.

As we go forth from this time together, may we carry the assurance of Your presence with us. Help us to be instruments of Your love and courage in the world, encouraging others to trust in You as we do.

We thank You for the opportunity to gather and share in this discussion. May our hearts be open to Your leading, and may we always remember that You are with us wherever we go.

In Jesus’ name, we pray. 

Amen.</i>
