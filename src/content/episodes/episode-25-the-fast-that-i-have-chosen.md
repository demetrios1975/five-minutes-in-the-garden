## Scripture Reading  
**Isaiah 58:6–11 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup> “Is not this the fast that I choose,” says the Lord, “but to loosen every bond of injustice, to untie the knots of violent transactions, to send away the oppressed in freedom, and to break every unjust contract?

<sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Share your bread with the hungry from your soul, and bring the poor who are without shelter into your house; if you see the naked, clothe him, and do not despise your own kin.

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then your light will break forth early, and your healings will spring up quickly; your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of God will surround you.

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then you will cry out, and God will hear you; while you are still speaking, he will say, “Behold, I am here.” If you remove from yourself the bond, the pointing finger, and the word of grumbling,

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> and give bread to the hungry from your soul and satisfy the humbled soul, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your gloom will be like noonday.

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And your God will be with you continually, and you will be satisfied just as your soul desires; your bones will be made fat, and you will be like a well-watered garden and like a spring whose water does not fail.

## Devotional Reflection

The people of Israel believed they were doing everything right.  
They fasted.  
They bowed their heads.  
They clothed themselves in ashes.

But God was not impressed.

Why? Because their fasting had become disconnected from their living. Their rituals were intact, but their compassion was missing. Their prayers were loud, but their mercy was quiet.

Through Isaiah, God redefines fasting:

***Set the oppressed free.  
Share your bread with the hungry.  
Shelter the poor.  
Clothe the naked.  
Stop hiding from your own flesh and blood.***

This is the fast that leads to light.  
This is the fast that brings healing.  
This is the fast that restores both the one who gives and the one who receives.

Lent is not about deprivation for its own sake.  
It is about transformation.  
It is about being turned outward—toward love, justice, and mercy.

And the promise is breathtaking:

*“Then your light shall break forth like the morning,  
and your healing shall spring up quickly.”*

## Closing Prayer

*Lord,  
As we prepare our hearts for Lent, teach us to seek the fast You have chosen.  
Not only to abstain from food, but to break bread with the hungry.  
Not only to avoid sin, but to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with You.*

*May our fasting become a light in the darkness—  
a living sign that Your love dwells in us  
and flows through us to the world.*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
