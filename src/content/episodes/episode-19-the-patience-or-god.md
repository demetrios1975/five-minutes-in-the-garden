## Scripture Reading  
**2 Peter 3:8–15 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But let not this one thing be hidden from you, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Since then all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,

<sup class="verse-num">12</sup> looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless.

<sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation.

## Devotional Reflection

Sometimes we wonder why God waits—  
why evil lingers,  
why justice seems delayed,  
why our prayers echo longer than we expect.

Peter gently reorients our vision.  
“The Lord is not slow,” he tells us.  
**He is patient.**

This patience is not passivity.  
It is purpose.

God delays the final curtain not out of indifference, but out of mercy—  
giving time for repentance, transformation, and return.  
Time for hearts to soften.  
Time for lives to be reordered toward peace.

Peter’s words do not stir panic, but readiness.  
Not fear, but holiness shaped by hope.  
Lent invites us to ask the same question Peter poses:  
*What sort of people ought we to be?*

The answer is quiet and demanding all at once—  
people of peace,  
people of holiness,  
people willing to live awake in the present moment.

God’s delay is your invitation.  
His patience is your chance to return.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord of time and mercy,  
Thank You for Your patience with us.*

*Awaken us to the fleeting nature of this world  
and the lasting beauty of holiness.  
Teach us to walk in peace, to live expectantly,  
and to treasure every moment of Your mercy.*

*May we be found ready—  
not perfect, but faithful.*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
