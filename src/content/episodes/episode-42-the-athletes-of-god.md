summary: "Today is a day of honor—a day to remember the men and women who trained their bodies and souls in the arena of ascetic struggle. On this Saturday of the Ascetics, we don’t mourn their hardships—we celebrate their perseverance. St. Paul compares the spiritual life to a race, one that requires focus, discipline, and sacrifice. As we prepare for the Fast, we are not entering a season of gloom, but a season of growth. Lent is not a funeral march. It is training camp for the soul. We lace up our spiritual shoes not to impress God, but to pursue Him."

## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.

<sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. They do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable one.

<sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air.

<sup class="verse-num">27</sup> But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, having preached to others, I myself should become disqualified.

## Devotional Reading

The Church calls this Saturday the Saturday of the Ascetics—a day to remember those who trained their hearts like Olympians. These were monks and martyrs, men and women who lived with spiritual intention, fasting not to boast, but to focus. They remind us: Lent is not a funeral. It is a spiritual boot camp.

We fast not to punish ourselves, but to awaken. We pray to stretch our soul. We give, not out of obligation, but as resistance to selfishness. We are in training—for love, for holiness, for God.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord,  
Train my hands for peace,  
My mind for wisdom,  
My soul for endurance.  
Help me run the race of faith with clarity and purpose.  
Let this Lenten season be a time of strengthening—not just of my will, but of my love.  
Let me not run aimlessly, but toward You, the true prize.  
Amen.*
