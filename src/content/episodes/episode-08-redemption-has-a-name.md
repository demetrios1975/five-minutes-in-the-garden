## Scripture Reading

Ruth 4:13–22 (KJV)

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup>So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son.

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup>And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.

<sup class="verse-num">15</sup>And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.

<sup class="verse-num">16</sup>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.

<sup class="verse-num">17</sup>And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.

<sup class="verse-num">18</sup>Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

<sup class="verse-num">19</sup>And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

<sup class="verse-num">20</sup>And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup>And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

<sup class="verse-num">22</sup>And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.


## Devotional Reflection

As we journey through Lent, consider this:

<b><i>Where has God quietly redeemed something in your life?
Who around you needs to be reminded their story isn’t over?
Are you planting seeds of faith, even when you can’t see the harvest?
</i></b>

God’s faithfulness often whispers. But it never fails.


## Closing Prayer

<i>Gracious and Redeeming God,

We thank You for the story of Ruth—for showing us that faithfulness in small things can echo through generations. Thank You for the hope we see in Naomi’s arms, and the promise You fulfilled through the line of David, leading to our Savior.

In the quiet moments of our lives, when things feel uncertain or lost, remind us that You are still writing the story. Teach us to be faithful like Ruth, kind like Boaz, and open like Naomi to Your unexpected blessings.

May our lives be part of something larger than we can see, and may we trust that redemption always has a name—Jesus.

In His name we pray,

Amen. </i>
