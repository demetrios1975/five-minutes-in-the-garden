## Scripture Reading

1 Kings 8:10–21
(Septuagint)

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup>And it came to pass when the priests came out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house.

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord filled the house.

<sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then Solomon said, The Lord said that he would dwell in thick darkness.

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever.

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel…

<sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and with his hands has fulfilled it, saying,

<sup class="verse-num">16</sup> From the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city… but I chose David to be over my people Israel.

<sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.


## Devotional Reflection

As we sit in the garden, consider:

<b><i>Where has God been faithful to complete what He once promised?
Am I willing to serve God’s purposes, even if I don’t see the finished work?
What kind of dwelling am I preparing for God in my own life?</i></b>

God still desires to dwell with His people.
And He is still building—patiently, purposefully, and faithfully.


## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father,

We thank You for being a God who keeps His promises and chooses to dwell among Your people. As You filled the temple with Your glory, fill our hearts with Your presence.

Teach us to trust You across seasons, to serve faithfully even when the work continues beyond us, and to prepare our lives as a dwelling place for Your Spirit.

May all we build be shaped by obedience, humility, and love for You.
In the name of Jesus, we pray.

Amen.</i>
