## Scripture Reading  
**Romans 13:11–14 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.

<sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Let us walk properly, as in the day—not in revelry and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in strife and jealousy.

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.

## Devotional Reflection

There is urgency in Paul’s voice.  
He does not tell us to wait until we feel ready.  
He tells us to **wake up**.

Lent is not about casually tidying our lives.  
It is a divine alarm clock—calling us out of sleep and into the light.

The “armor of light” may sound poetic, but it is deeply practical.  
It is honesty where we have hidden.  
Self-restraint where we have indulged.  
Courage where we have grown comfortable in the dark.

Paul calls us to walk in the day—not only when others are watching,  
but when no one is.  
In secret as well as in public.

“The night is nearly over,” he says.  
The Kingdom is closer than it has ever been.

So take off what weighs you down.  
Put on Christ.

He does not merely give light—  
**He is the Light.**

## Closing Prayer

*Lord Jesus Christ,  
You are the Light of the world.*

*Awaken us from spiritual sleep.  
Strip away what belongs to the night,  
and clothe us in Your life and truth.*

*Teach us to walk as children of the day—  
with honesty, restraint, and love.*

*For You live and reign,  
with the Father and the Holy Spirit,  
now and forever.  
Amen.*
