summary: "What if the most powerful thing you did today wasn’t noticed by anyone? What if heaven remembers the quietest kindness more than the loudest achievement? In Matthew 25, Jesus reveals that how we treat the vulnerable is how we treat Him."

## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">40</sup> “Truly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.”

## Devotional Reading

You don’t need a platform to make a difference.  
You need presence.

Ask yourself:

- **Who might feel invisible today?**
- **Where can I offer dignity without expecting anything in return?**
- **What small act can I do with great love?**

Jesus is saying: I was there—in that need, in that moment. And you saw Me.  
Let this transform how we see others—not as interruptions, but as invitations.

## Closing Prayer

*Father,  
You see what we often miss.  
You dwell among the least, the lowly, the overlooked.  
Give us eyes to recognize You there.  
Help us to live not for recognition, but for faithfulness.  
Make our hands ready to serve, our hearts quick to respond.  
In every act of kindness, may we honor You.  
Amen.*
