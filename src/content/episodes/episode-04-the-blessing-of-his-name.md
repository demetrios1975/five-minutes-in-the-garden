## Scripture Reading

Numbers 6:22–27 (KJV)

<sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

<sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

<sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:

<sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

<sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.

## Devotional Reflection

<b><i>Hear this blessing—not as ancient poetry, but as living truth. You are seen. You are kept. You are graced. And you are held in peace, as we all are by God.

And just as the priests spoke blessing over the people, may you be an instrument of blessing to someone else today. Speak life, speak peace, and walk in the light of His face.</i></b>


## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father, 

We thank You for this day. We thank You for the Book of Numbers and for the beautiful Scripture we find there today. We thank You for the blessings that You spoke over Your people. We thank You for Your protection, Your light, Your warmth, Your mercy, and the Shalom that You give us—the peace that You give us.

Lord, I want to thank You for seeing us, for keeping us, for gracing us, and for holding us in peace. And Lord, we just ask that all that we do be pleasing to You. And as we walk this journey of life, Lord, we ask that we radiate Your glory and Your light so that everyone can feel the power of Your love and Your mercy and Your greatness.

All this I ask in Jesus’ name. 

Amen.</i>
