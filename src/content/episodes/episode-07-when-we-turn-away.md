## Scripture Reading

Judges 2:16–23 (KJV)

<sup class="verse-num">16</sup>Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

<sup class="verse-num">17</sup>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the Lord; but they did not so.

<sup class="verse-num">18</sup>And when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.

<sup class="verse-num">19</sup>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers...

<sup class="verse-num">20</sup>And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant...

<sup class="verse-num">21</sup>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:

<sup class="verse-num">22</sup>That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.

<sup class="verse-num">23</sup>Therefore the Lord left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.


## Devotional Reflection

The Book of Judges is a mirror. We see our cycles, our struggles, and—thank God—our Savior.

So today, reflect. Return. And rejoice in the mercy that meets us again and again.


## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father,

We come before You with humble hearts, grateful for the lessons found in Your Word. As we reflect on the cycle of sin and redemption in the Book of Judges, we recognize our own struggles and the times we have turned away from You. We thank You for Your unwavering faithfulness and mercy, even when we falter.

Lord, as we journey through this Lenten season, help us to examine our hearts and identify the areas where we need to return to You. May we be open to Your guidance and willing to seek forgiveness for our shortcomings. Strengthen us to resist the temptations that lead us away from Your path and empower us to follow You wholeheartedly.

We also lift up our leaders—pastors, mentors, and those who guide us in faith. Grant them wisdom and strength as they shepherd us closer to You. May we support one another in our spiritual journeys, encouraging each other to remain steadfast in our commitment to You.

As we go forth from this time together, may we carry the lessons of Your Word in our hearts. Help us to be instruments of Your love and grace in the world, reflecting Your light to those around us.

In Jesus’ name, we pray. 

Amen.</i>
