## Scripture Reading

1 Samuel 16:6–13 (KJV)

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before him.

<sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not chosen these.

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

<sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.


## Devotional Reflection

As we reflect during Lent, ask yourself:

<b><i>What parts of my heart still need to yield to God?
Am I measuring my worth—or the worth of others—by outward things?
What “Davids” might I be overlooking?</i></b>

Let’s be the kind of people God can call—because we’ve done the inner work of aligning our hearts with His.


## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father,

We thank You for the truth found in Your Word and for the powerful example of David’s anointing. As we reflect on this passage, we are reminded that You look beyond outward appearances and see our hearts. Help us to cultivate hearts that seek after You and align with Your will.

Lord, may we not judge others by their outward appearances but instead recognize the potential You have placed within each person. Teach us to value what You value and to seek Your guidance in our own lives.

As we go forth from this time together, may we be inspired to lead with integrity and humility, just as David did. Fill us with Your Spirit, empowering us to fulfill the purposes You have for us.

In Jesus' name, we pray. 

Amen.</I>
