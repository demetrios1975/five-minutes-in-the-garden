## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Create in me a clean heart, O God,  
and renew a right spirit within me.

## Devotional Reflection

As we move through this first week of Great Lent, something begins to surface.

When we fast, we notice our impulses.  
When we pray, we notice our distractions.  
When we keep watch, we notice our weakness.

And so today, we pray one of the most ancient and honest prayers in Scripture:

“Create in me a clean heart.”

Today, don’t just ask for strength.

Ask for renewal.

**Ask God to soften what has grown rigid.**  
**To cleanse what has grown cluttered.**  
**To restore what has grown cold.**

The miracle of Lent is not that we try harder.

It is that God recreates us from within.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord,  
Create in me a clean heart.  
Not a slightly improved one — but a renewed one.  
Remove what has grown hard within me.  
Restore joy where it has faded.  
Renew a right spirit within me.  
Make this Lent a season of true transformation.  
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
