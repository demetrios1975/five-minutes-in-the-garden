summary: "As we near the start of Great Lent, today’s reading from St. Paul reminds us of what truly matters. It’s not the food we eat—or don’t eat—that defines our faith. It’s how we love one another, how we build each other up, and how we avoid letting personal conviction become communal division."

## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Let us therefore pursue the things that make for peace and the things by which one may edify another.

<sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man who eats with offense.

<sup class="verse-num">21</sup> It is good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is made weak.

## Devotional Reading

In our own spiritual lives, it’s easy to become proud of our disciplines—our fasts, our prayer routines, our theology. But Paul gently urges us to remember the goal: mutual upbuilding. Our walk with Christ isn’t a solo sprint—it’s a shared pilgrimage.

This Lent, fast with humility. Feast on kindness. Choose compassion over culinary perfection. Be more concerned with nourishing others than proving your own devotion.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord Jesus Christ,  
You are the Bread of Life and the Prince of Peace.  
As we prepare our hearts for Lent, help us not to elevate fasting above love, or rules above relationships.  
Give us the wisdom to build one another up, and the humility to put peace before pride.  
May our spiritual discipline never be a stumbling block, but a source of encouragement to those around us.  
In Your holy name we pray,  
Amen.*
