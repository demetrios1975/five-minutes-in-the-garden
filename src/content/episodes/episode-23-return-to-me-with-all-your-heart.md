## Scripture Reading  
**Joel 2:12–13 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">12</sup> “Now,” says the Lord your God, “Turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting and with weeping and with mourning.

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Rend your hearts and not your garments, and return to the Lord your God. For He is merciful and compassionate, slow to anger, and abundant in mercy, and He will relent from calamity.”

## Devotional Reflection

So often we clean up our appearance—our schedules, our surface behaviors—while leaving our hearts untouched.

God does not ask for an outward show of sorrow.  
He desires the kind of repentance that tears through layers of pride and distraction.  
Not merely the rending of garments, but the breaking open of the spirit before Him.

This passage reminds us that God is not distant or rigid.  
He is merciful.  
He is compassionate.  
He is waiting.

And He invites us back—not reluctantly, but with joy, because that is who He is.

Lent is not only a time of discipline.  
It is a return to the One who loves us most.

## Closing Prayer

*Merciful Lord,  
We hear Your invitation to come home—not with shame, but with hope.  
Soften our hearts. Help us lay down our pride and return to You in truth and tenderness.  
May our repentance lead to healing, and may our brokenness be the very place where Your mercy is made new.  
Amen.*
