## Scripture Reading

John 20:11–18 (Septuagint)

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping, and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the tomb.

<sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.”

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.

<sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, “Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.”

<sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to Him, “Master!”

## Devotional Reflection

We have walked through promise and presence, pruning and hope.
Today, we arrive at fulfillment.
Not in a palace.
Not on a throne.
But in a garden—early in the morning, while the world is still quiet.

## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father,

We thank You for the risen Christ—the fulfillment of every promise and the restoration of all things. When we struggle to recognize You, call us gently by name.

Open our eyes to see Your presence in quiet places, and give us hearts that respond in love and trust.

May we live as people of resurrection hope, carrying life into every place You send us.

In the name of Jesus, our risen King, we pray.

Amen.</i>
