## Scripture Reading  
**Matthew 25:31–36 (LXX)**

<sup class="verse-num">31</sup> When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory.

<sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

<sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.

<sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Then the King will say to those on His right hand, “Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

<sup class="verse-num">35</sup> for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;

<sup class="verse-num">36</sup> I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.”

## Devotional Reflection

If you’ve ever wondered what God wants from your life, this passage gives you the answer: serve others with love. Especially those who can’t repay you. Especially those who are overlooked.

This is a reminder that the Kingdom of God is built on the small, unseen acts of kindness. And that faith without love is empty.

**Ask yourself today:  
• Who is hungry around me?  
• Who is lonely?  
• Who is aching for compassion?**  

Find them. Serve them. And in doing so, you will be meeting Christ Himself.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord,  
You taught us that what we do for the least of these, we do for You.  
Soften our hearts to see the needs around us.  
Give us courage to act, to love, and to serve.  
Let our faith be known not in words, but in mercy.  
Prepare us to stand before You with joy,  
having lived lives of compassion.  
In Your name we pray,  
Amen.*
