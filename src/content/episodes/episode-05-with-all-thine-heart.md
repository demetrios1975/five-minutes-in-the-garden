## Scripture Reading

Deuteronomy 6:4–9 (KJV)

<sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

<sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:

<sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.


## Devotional Reflection

So today, beloved, hear this call:

<b><i>Worship the Lord, and Him alone.
Love Him with every part of who you are.
Speak of Him to your children and in your daily rhythms.
Make your home a place where His name is known.</i></b>

For the Lord our God is one Lord—and He is worthy of all thine heart.


## Closing Prayer

<i>Lord our God,

You are one—holy, undivided, and worthy of all our devotion.
Teach us first to hear:
to listen with hearts made quiet before You.

Write Your words upon our hearts,
that we may love You not in part, but in fullness—
with all our heart, all our soul, and all our strength.

Let Your truth shape our thoughts, guide our hands,
and dwell within our homes.

May our daily rhythms—our rising and our resting,
our walking and our speaking—
bear witness to Your faithfulness.

Give us grace to live our faith out loud,
to pass it on with care and intention,
and to make our lives a sign of Your presence.

For You alone are the Lord our God,
and You are worthy of all thine heart.

Amen. </i>
