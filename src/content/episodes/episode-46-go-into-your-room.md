summary: "As we continue into Great Lent, we are not only called to fast — we are called to pray. But Jesus once again shifts our focus from outward action to inward posture.

## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward.

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.

<sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.

## Devotional Reading

This week, carve out a literal space.  
**A chair.**  
**A corner.**  
**A moment before the day begins.**

Close the door — physically or metaphorically.

Let prayer become less about saying everything  
and more about being present.

You do not need impressive language.  
You need honesty.

## Closing Prayer

*Father,  
Teach me to pray simply.  
Draw me into the quiet place where You already wait.  
Calm my anxious words.  
Strengthen my trust.  
As I walk through this season of Lent, let prayer anchor my heart in You.  
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
