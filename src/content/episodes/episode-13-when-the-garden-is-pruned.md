## Scripture Reading

Psalm 89:28–37
(Septuagint)


<sup class="verse-num">28</sup>My mercy will I keep for him for ever, and my covenant is sure to him.

<sup class="verse-num">29</sup>And I will establish his seed for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.

<sup class="verse-num">30</sup>If his children should forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

<sup class="verse-num">31</sup> if they should profane my ordinances, and not keep my commandments;

<sup class="verse-num">32</sup> I will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their sin with scourges.

<sup class="verse-num">33</sup> But my mercy will I not utterly take from him, nor will I suffer my truth to fail.

<sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Neither will I profane my covenant, nor will I make void the things that have gone out of my lips.

<sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie to David.

<sup class="verse-num">36</sup> His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me;

<sup class="verse-num">37</sup> and as the moon established for ever, and the faithful witness in heaven.


## Devotional Reflection

As we sit in the garden, consider:

<b><i>Where in my life does pruning feel painful right now?
Am I mistaking discipline for abandonment?
Can I trust God’s covenant even when growth feels slow or unseen?</i></b>

The garden may look quiet.
But God is still at work.
And His promises remain faithful witnesses—day and night.


## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father,

We thank You that Your mercy does not fail, even when we do. In seasons when the garden feels bare, help us trust that You are still tending what You love.

Teach us to receive correction without fear, to endure pruning with hope, and to rest in the promise that You will never make void the words You have spoken.

May our faith take deeper root as we wait on You.

In the name of Jesus, we pray.

Amen.</i>
