## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">40</sup> "Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, 'What? Could you not watch with Me one hour?

<sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.'"

## Devotional Reflection

As we move deeper into this first week of Great Lent, we begin to feel something real:

Fatigue.  
Distraction.  
Irritation.  
Spiritual fog.

Lent is not only about fasting and prayer — it is about watchfulness.

Today, we listen to Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He speaks a simple but piercing command:

“Watch and pray.”

Jesus asked for one hour.

Today, can you give Him intentional time?

**Turn off the noise.**  
**Step away from distraction.**  
**Notice where your mind wanders.**

Lent trains the soul not just to sacrifice — but to stay awake.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord Jesus,  
You asked Your disciples to watch with You.  
Teach me not to sleep through the moments that matter.  
Strengthen my weak flesh.  
Sharpen my wandering mind.  
Keep my heart awake to Your presence.  
Let this Lent not pass me by in distraction.  
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
