## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">1</sup> "Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven.

<sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward.

<sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,

<sup class="verse-num">4</sup> that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly."

## Devotional Reflection

As we continue our first week of Great Lent, we’ve spoken about fasting. We’ve spoken about prayer. Today, we turn to the third pillar Christ gives us in the Sermon on the Mount: mercy.

In Matthew chapter 6, Jesus teaches us not just that we should give — but how.

And once again, He leads us away from performance and into something hidden.

This week, give in a way that costs you something.

**Give time.**  
**Give attention.**  
**Give forgiveness.**

Give without announcing it.  
Let it remain between you and the Father.

The secret acts of mercy reshape the soul more than public gestures ever could.

## Closing Prayer

*Father,  
Teach me to give quietly.  
Guard my heart from seeking applause.  
Let my generosity flow from love, not image.  
Help me serve without needing to be seen.  
And may this Lent soften my heart toward those in need.  
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
