## Scripture Reading  
**Luke 18:9–14 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And He also spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> “Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, ‘God, I thank You that I am not as other men—extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.

<sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess.’

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But the tax collector, standing far off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but struck his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me a sinner!’

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”

## Devotional Reflection

As we prepare our hearts for Lent, this parable gives us a foundation:  
spiritual renewal begins in repentance.

Both men pray.  
Both address God.  
But only one leaves justified.

The Pharisee’s prayer is filled with comparison—measured righteousness, spiritual résumé, visible obedience.  
The tax collector’s prayer is simple, honest, and desperate.

***We are not invited to climb a ladder of righteousness, but to descend into humility.***

The tax collector walks away justified—not because of what he did, but because he knew what he needed.  
That’s where Lent begins: not in striving, but in surrender.

True prayer is not about impressing God.  
It is about standing truthfully before Him.

## Closing Prayer

*Merciful God,  
We come before You like the tax collector—aware of our need, aware of Your grace.  
Teach us to pray not from pride but from humility.  
Strip away the layers of performance and comparison.  
Let us be honest with You and with ourselves.*

*Lord, we do not earn Your mercy—we receive it.  
And in receiving it, we are changed.*

*Help us begin this Lent with the right posture—  
not trying to impress, but ready to be transformed.*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
