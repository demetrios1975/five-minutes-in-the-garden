## Scripture Reading
Luke 19:5–6 (Septuagint) 

<sup class="verse-num">5</sup>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. 

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup>And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.


## Devotional Reflection

In today’s devotional, we look at the moment Christ invites Himself into Zacchaeus’s home—and more importantly, into his heart. Through the eyes of St. Augustine, we’re reminded that welcoming Jesus is not just external hospitality—it’s a transformation of the heart.

## Closing Prayer

<i>Lord Jesus,

Just as You called Zacchaeus down from the tree, call us out of our comfort and distraction. We want to welcome You—not just into our homes or routines, but into the depths of our hearts.

Thank You for seeing us before we ever saw You. Thank You for grace that meets us even before we change. May our lives respond with generosity, humility, and action.

Help us to examine what still needs to be surrendered. And may we, like Zacchaeus, receive You joyfully, allowing Your presence to reorder our priorities.

Dwell in us richly, Lord—so that others may see You through our lives.
In Your holy name we pray,

Amen.</I>
