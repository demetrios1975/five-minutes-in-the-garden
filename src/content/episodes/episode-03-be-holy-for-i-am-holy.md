## Scripture Reading

Genesis 2:15–17 (KJV)

<sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

<sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:

<sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup>

## Devotional Reflection

<b><i>We often think boundaries restrict our joy. But just like a guardrail on a mountain road, God’s boundaries are there to keep us on the path of life. They allow us to enjoy the journey without falling off the cliff.

So today, if you are bumping up against a limit in your life—whether it's moral, physical, or relational—don't resent it. Thank God for the guardrail.</i></b>


## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father, 

We confess that we often want life without limits. We want to be our own gods. But we thank You for Your boundaries. Thank You for the "no" that protects us, and the "yes" that provides for us.

Help us to trust Your wisdom more than our own desires. Teach us to see Your commandments not as burdens, but as blessings that keep us safe in Your care.

We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ. 

Amen. </i>
