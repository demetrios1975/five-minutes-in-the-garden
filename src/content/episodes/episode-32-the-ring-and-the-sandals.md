## Scripture Reading  
**Luke 15:22–24**

<sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.

<sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;

<sup class="verse-num">24</sup> for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ And they began to be merry.

## Devotional Reflection

Maybe you’ve come back to God before—but you’re still walking around barefoot, feeling like a second-class citizen in the kingdom.

Let today be the moment you receive the ring and the sandals.

God doesn’t just tolerate your return—He rejoices in it. He doesn’t demote you—He delights in you.

You are not a visitor in the house of God.  
You are His child.

The robe restores dignity.  
The ring restores identity.  
The sandals restore freedom.

This is not reluctant forgiveness.  
This is extravagant restoration.

## Closing Prayer

*Father,  
Thank You for Your extravagant mercy.  
You don’t just welcome us home—You celebrate.  
You clothe us, restore us, and call us Your own.  
Help me to live as one who is not just forgiven,  
but restored, beloved, and free.  
May I walk in the dignity and authority of a child of God.  
In Jesus’ name,  
Amen.*
