## Scripture Reading

2 Samuel 7:8–16

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup>And now thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the fold of the sheep that thou shouldest be a ruler over my people, over Israel.

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and I destroyed all thine enemies from before thee, and I made thee a name according to the name of the great ones that are upon the earth.

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and shall not be distressed any more; and the son of iniquity shall no more afflict them as at the beginning,

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup> from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give thee rest from all thine enemies. And the Lord declares to thee that thou shalt build a house to him.

<sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And it shall come to pass when thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, even thine own issue, and I will establish his kingdom.

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He shall build a house to my name, and I will set up his throne even for ever.

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And when he happens to transgress, then will I chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men.

<sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it away from Saul whom I removed from my presence.

<sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And his house shall be made sure, and his kingdom for ever before me, and his throne shall be established for ever.

## Devotional Reflection

As we reflect, ask yourself:

<b><i>Am I trusting in God’s promises, even when I can’t see the full picture?
What kind of spiritual legacy am I building?
How has God taken me from a place of obscurity to a place of purpose?</i></b>

God’s hand is still writing stories. His covenant still holds.
And His kingdom? Still being established—in us and through us.


## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father,

We come before You with grateful hearts, thanking You for the truth found in Your Word. As we reflect on the covenant You made with David, we are reminded of Your faithfulness and the promises that endure through generations. Help us to recognize Your hand in our lives and to trust in Your plans for us.

Lord, may we be inspired by David’s story to seek after Your heart and to lead with integrity and humility. Teach us to value the legacy we leave behind and to invest in the faith of those who come after us.
As we go forth from this time together, may we carry the lessons of Your Word in our hearts. Empower us by Your Spirit to fulfill the purposes You have for us.

In Jesus’ name, we pray. 

Amen.</i>
