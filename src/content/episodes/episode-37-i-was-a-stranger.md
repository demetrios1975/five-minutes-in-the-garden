passage: "Matthew 25:35–36 (LXX)"
summary: "In a world that builds walls and draws borders, Christ calls us to open doors. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus identifies Himself not with the powerful or familiar—but with the stranger. Hospitality, then, is more than etiquette; it is sacred."

## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">35</sup> for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;  
<sup class="verse-num">36</sup> I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.

## Devotional Reading

Hospitality can take many forms:

- **A shared meal.**
- **A seat at your table.**
- **A listening ear.**
- **A space where someone isn’t judged or excluded.**

When we open our lives to others, especially those we don’t know or understand, we become stewards of God’s mercy.

Ask yourself today:

- **Who in my life feels like a stranger?**
- **How can I offer welcome, not just comfort?**
- **Where is Christ knocking, disguised as the unfamiliar?**

Let your home, your church, your heart be a refuge for the outsider.

## Closing Prayer

*Heavenly Father,  
Your Son was once a stranger in this world,  
unrecognized, rejected, and turned away.  
Teach us to welcome as You welcome.  
Soften our guarded hearts.  
Help us to see Your face in those we do not yet know.  
Make our lives open doors for others to find peace and belonging.  
In Your holy name we pray,  
Amen.*
