summary: "We’ve journeyed through a season of preparation, and now we arrive at the threshold of Great Lent. Today is known as Forgiveness Sunday—a day that reminds us the fast is not primarily about food, but about the heart. Before we can enter the wilderness, we must first let go of what we’ve been carrying. Jesus makes it clear: if we want to be forgiven, we must forgive. This is the final key that unlocks the gate to the Lenten journey."

## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup> *For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.*

<sup class="verse-num">15</sup> *But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.*

<sup class="verse-num">16</sup> *And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.*

<sup class="verse-num">17</sup> *But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,*

<sup class="verse-num">18</sup> *that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.*

<sup class="verse-num">19</sup> *Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,*

<sup class="verse-num">20</sup> *but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.*

<sup class="verse-num">21</sup> *For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.*

## Devotional Reading

This day is also known as the Sunday of the Expulsion of Adam. In many Orthodox churches, the icon of Adam and Eve being cast out of Eden is placed before the faithful. But this isn’t the end—it’s a new beginning.

Lent is the long walk home.

To take that first step, we must lighten our load. Forgive. Ask forgiveness. Make peace, so that you can begin the journey free and unburdened.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.*  

*Teach me to forgive as I have been forgiven.*  

*Cleanse my heart of bitterness and pride.*

*As I begin this fast, help me release all that holds me back—grudges, wounds, and resentments.*

*Open the gate before me, and lead me through this wilderness with humility, courage, and joy.*  

*Amen.*
