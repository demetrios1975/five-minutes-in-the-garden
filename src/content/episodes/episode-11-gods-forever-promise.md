## Scripture Reading

2 Samuel 7:8–16
(Septuagint)


<sup class="verse-num">8</sup>And now thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the fold of the sheep that thou shouldest be a ruler over my people, over Israel.

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and I destroyed all thine enemies from before thee, and I made thee a name according to the name of the great ones that are upon the earth.

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and shall not be distressed any more; and the son of iniquity shall no more afflict them as at the beginning,

<sup class="verse-num">11</sup> from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give thee rest from all thine enemies. And the Lord declares to thee that thou shalt build a house to him.

<sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And it shall come to pass when thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, even thine own issue, and I will establish his kingdom.

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He shall build a house to my name, and I will set up his throne even for ever.

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And when he happens to transgress, then will I chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men.

<sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it away from Saul whom I removed from my presence.

<sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And his house shall be made sure, and his kingdom for ever before me, and his throne shall be established for ever.


## Devotional Reflection

As we sit in the garden with these words, consider:

<b><i>Where in my life is God reminding me, “I took you from the fold”? How has He been faithful through it all?
Am I trusting His promise of an eternal throne, even when today feels uncertain?
What legacy of faith am I nurturing—for my family, my community, and the generations to come?</i></b>

God’s hand is still at work.
His covenant stands firm.
And His kingdom is being established—right here, in our hearts and through our lives.




## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father,

We bow before You in awe of Your unchanging Word. Thank You for the covenant You made with David—from the sheepfold to an eternal throne. We praise You that this promise reaches its fullness in Jesus Christ, our King forever.

Help us to see Your hand in our own stories: the places You’ve taken us from, the presence You’ve never withdrawn, and the mercy that endures even when we stumble.

Strengthen our trust in Your forever kingdom, and inspire us to live in a way that builds lasting legacy for those who follow.

May Your Spirit empower us to walk humbly, love faithfully, and point others to the One whose throne is established forever.

In the name of Jesus, our eternal King, we pray.

Amen.</i>
