## Scripture Reading  
**1 Peter 1:3–9 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to His great mercy, He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

<sup class="verse-num">4</sup> to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,

<sup class="verse-num">5</sup> who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials,

<sup class="verse-num">7</sup> so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Though you have not seen Him, you love Him. Though you do not now see Him, you believe in Him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

## Devotional Reflection

Peter does not downplay the pain of trials—but he reframes them.

Suffering, he tells us, is not evidence of God’s absence.  
It is the place where faith is refined.

Like gold tested by fire, faith that endures becomes stronger, purer, and more radiant. And the reward is not merely endurance—it is joy. A joy that is deep, steady, and unshaken by circumstance.

Peter calls it a *living* hope because it does not expire or fade.  
It is not rooted in feelings or outcomes, but in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

That changes everything.

Even in seasons of grief, believers rejoice—not because life is easy, but because the story does not end in loss. Our inheritance is guarded by God Himself, and our salvation is already unfolding.

This hope does not deny hardship.  
It meets us within it—and carries us through.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord,  
Thank You for the living hope we have in Christ.*

*When life feels uncertain, anchor us in the certainty of Your promises.  
Refine our faith through every trial and draw us closer to You.  
Help us rejoice—not because of circumstances, but because of the inheritance You have prepared for us.*

*May our hope remain alive, our joy remain full,  
and our eyes remain fixed on eternity.*

*Amen.*
