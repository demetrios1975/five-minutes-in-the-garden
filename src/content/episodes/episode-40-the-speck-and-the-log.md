summary: "As we stand at the edge of the Lenten season, Scripture gently turns our attention inward. It is easier to measure the faults of others than to confront the hidden corners of our own hearts. Yet before we can walk into a season of repentance, Christ calls us to something deeper than observation—He calls us to honest self-examination. Today’s reading from the Gospel of Matthew invites us to lay down the magnifying glass we hold over others and instead pick up the mirror. It is a call to clarity, humility, and mercy."

## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Judge not, that you be not judged.

<sup class="verse-num">2</sup> For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

<sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the log in your own eye?

<sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’; and behold, a log is in your own eye?

<sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Hypocrite! First remove the log from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

## Devotional Reading

This teaching isn’t a prohibition against helping others grow or holding them accountable—it’s an invitation to humility. We are called to self-examination, not self-excusal.

- **Before criticizing, pause and ask: Is there something in me that needs healing first?**
- **Before correcting, reflect: Am I offering help or seeking to elevate myself?**
- **Before judging, pray: Lord, show me what I need to see in myself.**

The call is not to silence, but to transformation—from within.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord Jesus,  
You see every part of us—our thoughts, motives, and blind spots.  
Forgive us for the times we’ve focused more on others’ faults than our own.  
Give us the courage to examine our hearts with honesty and grace.  
Help us remove what clouds our vision so we may see clearly, love deeply, and speak gently.  
Shape us into people of mercy, reflection, and restoration.  
In Your holy name we pray,  
Amen.*
