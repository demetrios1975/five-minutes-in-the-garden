## Scripture Reading  
**Ezekiel 36:24–28 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And I will take you out from the nations, and will gather you out of all the lands, and will bring you into your own land.

<sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your impurities, and from all your idols will I cleanse you.

<sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And I will give you a new heart, and will put a new spirit in you: and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.

<sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And I will put My Spirit in you, and will cause you to walk in My ordinances, and to keep My judgments, and do them.

<sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And ye shall dwell upon the land which I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be to Me a people, and I will be to you a God.

## Devotional Reflection

This passage from Ezekiel is one of the most hope-filled promises in all of Scripture.

The people of Israel had been scattered, exiled, and defiled by sin.  
And yet here, God initiates a radical restoration—not just externally, but deep within the human heart.

“I will sprinkle clean water upon you.”  
This is not mere forgiveness.  
It is purification.

God does not simply overlook sin—He washes it away.  
He removes the residue of idolatry, shame, and spiritual exhaustion.

“I will give you a new heart.”  
What a promise.

So often, we try to manage our old heart.  
We soften it, restrain it, negotiate with it.

But God offers something far greater:  
a complete replacement.

A heart of flesh instead of stone.  
A heart that can feel, respond, and love again.

And finally, He places His own Spirit within us—  
not as an external rulebook, but as an inner guide.

Lent is not about forcing ourselves to change.  
It is about allowing God to remake us.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord God,  
You are the One who restores what is hardened and worn.*

*Cleanse us from what clings to us.  
Remove the hearts of stone we cannot soften on our own.  
Give us hearts that can receive You.*

*Place Your Spirit within us,  
and teach us to walk in Your ways—not by fear,  
but by love.*

*For You are our God,  
and we are Your people.*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
