## Scripture Reading

Genesis 1:1–5 (KJV)

<sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

<sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

<sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

<sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

<sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

## Devotional Reflection

<b><i>God didn't have to wrestle the darkness. He just spoke to it. He said, "Let there be light," and the darkness had no choice but to yield. Whatever chaos you are facing today, invite God to speak into it. His Word is the light you need.</i></b>

## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father, 

We thank You for being the God of the beginning. We confess that sometimes our lives feel without form and void. We feel overwhelmed by the darkness.

But we thank You that Your Spirit is moving, even now. Speak Your light into our situations, Lord. Give us the peace that comes from knowing You are in control. Help us to trust that You are bringing order out of our chaos.

We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ.</i>
