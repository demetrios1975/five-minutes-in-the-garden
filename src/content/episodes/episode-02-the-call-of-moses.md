## Scripture Reading

Genesis 2:7 (KJV)



<sup class="verse-num">7</sup>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul

## Devotional Reflection

<b><i>We are not just biology; we are spiritual beings. We were made to connect with the One who breathed life into us.

So today, if you feel heavy, remember you are dust. But if you feel worthless, remember you are His breath.</I></b>


## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father, 

Thank You for making us. Thank You for this reminder that we are dust, so we don't have to carry the weight of the world. But thank You also that we carry Your breath.

Lord, for anyone listening who feels small or forgotten, remind them of the dignity You placed inside them. Help us to live today not just as surviving bodies, but as living souls, connected to You.

We ask this in Jesus’ name. 

Amen.</I>
