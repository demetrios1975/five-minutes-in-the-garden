## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">19</sup> “As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.”

The Bridegroom has gone to His Passion. And so the Fast begins.

## Devotional Reflection

As we continue our journey through Great Lent, the Church gives us strong language.

It calls this season an arena.

• **Not a vacation.**  
• **Not a pause.**  
• **An arena.**

Today’s reflection echoes the hymns of the Lenten Triodion sung at Forgiveness Vespers as we begin the Fast.

They remind us that Lent is not merely about abstinence. It is about entering the struggle with intention.

But the hymn does not end in struggle.

It ends in hope:

“So that we may be worthy to see the holy Passion of Christ our God and the joy of His holy Resurrection.”

Lent is not the end.

Resurrection is.

The arena prepares us for joy.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord,  
As I enter the arena of this Holy Fast, give me courage.  
Purify my heart.  
Sanctify my soul.  
Teach me to fast not only from food, but from every passion that clouds my vision.  
Let this struggle lead me not to pride — but to resurrection joy.  
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
