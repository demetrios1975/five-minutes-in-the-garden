## Scripture Reading  
**James 4:6–10 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”

<sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.

## Devotional Reflection

We often think of pride as arrogance—a loud, boastful spirit.  
But more often, pride hides quietly.

It shows up in the refusal to ask for help.  
In the insistence on doing life our own way.  
In the resistance to change, correction, or surrender.

Pride closes the door.  
But humility opens it wide.

James does not leave room for ambiguity: God gives grace, but grace flows only where humility makes space. When we finally stop posturing—when we kneel in our hearts and say, *“Lord, I need You”*—God is already there, waiting.

And this is the mercy of it all: God does not leave us in the dust of our shame.  
He lifts us.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord,  
I have often relied on myself.  
My pride has stood between us.*

*Today, I choose humility.  
I draw near—imperfect, but willing.*

*Resist the proud in me,  
and grow something softer in its place.*

*You promise to lift the lowly.  
Lift me, Lord. Lift me by Your grace.*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
