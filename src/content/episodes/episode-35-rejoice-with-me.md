summary: "In Luke 15, Jesus shares parables that reveal the heart of God toward those who are lost and return. One of the most tender is the image of a shepherd rejoicing when a lost sheep is found. This episode of Five Minutes in the Garden invites us to reframe repentance—not as a burden or a shame-filled act—but as something that sparks divine celebration."

## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup> “Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.

<sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I say to you, that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance.”

## Devotional Reading

Repentance is not just about sorrow. It’s about restoration. If you’ve wandered, even for a day, don’t stay lost. Return. Know that you’re not coming back to a cold judge — you’re returning to a joyful Father.

And if someone else around you repents — don’t grumble like the elder brother. Rejoice. Join the party. God does.

## Closing Prayer

_Heavenly Father,  
You never give up on me, even when I stray.  
Thank You for carrying me back with joy.  
Help me to repent quickly and gladly,  
and to celebrate the return of others.  
Let my heart echo the joy of heaven.  
Amen._
