title: "The Far Country"

cover: "/episode-art/episode-30.jpg"
passage: "Luke 15:13–16 (Septuagint)"
summary: "Before the son could return home, he had to leave. Jesus’ parable opens not with reconciliation, but with departure—a slow unraveling of inheritance, identity, and direction. The far country becomes a mirror for every soul who has tried to live apart from God, chasing autonomy and pleasure only to discover famine and emptiness. Before the embrace, there is hunger. Before the welcome, there is wandering."

## Scripture Reading  
**Luke 15:13–16 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And not many days after the younger son, having gathered all together, departed into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.

<sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.

<sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

<sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

## Devotional Reflection

Lent is a time to recognize our own far countries.

Maybe it is busyness that has numbed your soul.  
Maybe it is resentment.  
Maybe it is chasing pleasure, performance, or approval.

The younger son thought freedom meant distance.  
He mistook inheritance for independence.  
He confused appetite with fulfillment.

And then came the famine.

This is not yet a story of repentance.  
It is a story of recognition.

**What have you wasted that God entrusted to you?  
Where are you feeding pigs when you were made for feasting in the Father’s house?**

This is not about guilt.  
It is about clarity.

Until we name the far country, we cannot begin the journey home.

## Closing Prayer

*Heavenly Father,  
I confess that I have wandered.  
I have wasted gifts and chased shadows.  
I have tried to feed my soul on things that do not satisfy.  
Bring me to my senses.  
Give me the courage to take the first step home.  
And remind me:  
You are waiting.*

*Amen.*
