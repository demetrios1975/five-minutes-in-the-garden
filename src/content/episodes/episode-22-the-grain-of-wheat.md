## Scripture Reading  
**John 12:23–26 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.

<sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.

<sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.

<sup class="verse-num">26</sup> If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.

## Devotional Reflection

***As we move closer to Lent, Christ’s words grow sharper and more intimate. He does not speak in riddles here—He speaks plainly of the way of life through death.***

“Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies…”

Jesus is speaking first of Himself. The cross is no accident, no tragedy to be avoided. It is the path appointed for glory. Resurrection comes only through burial.

But He is also speaking to us.

The life that clings to control, comfort, reputation, or self-preservation will ultimately remain alone. It may survive—but it will not bear fruit. True fruitfulness comes only through surrender.

This is not a call to despise life, but to loosen our grip on it. To lay down the false self so that the true self—hidden with Christ—may rise.

Lent teaches us this same paradox:  
that letting go is not loss,  
that obedience is not death,  
and that surrender is the doorway to abundance.

The grain that dies does not disappear.  
It multiplies.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord Jesus,  
You are the grain of wheat who fell into the earth for our salvation.  
Teach us to follow You—not only in words, but in the quiet deaths of pride, fear, and self-will.  
Help us trust that what is surrendered to You is never wasted.  
May our lives bear fruit that remains.*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
Amen.*
