## Scripture Reading

Jeremiah 1:4–10 (Septuagint) - 

<sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

<sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you; and before you came forth from the belly, I sanctified you. I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.

<sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And I said, “O Lord, Sovereign Lord, behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am a child.”

<sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And the Lord said to me: “Do not say, ‘I am a child,’ for you shall go to everyone I send you to, and you shall speak whatever I command you.

<sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you,” says the Lord.

<sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then the Lord stretched forth His hand and touched my mouth. And the Lord said to me: “Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.

<sup class="verse-num">10</sup> See, today I have appointed you over nations and over kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to demolish, to build and to plant.”


## Devotional Reflection
Jeremiah’s story doesn’t begin with boldness—it begins with insecurity. When God calls him, Jeremiah doesn’t feel ready.

## Closing Prayer
<i>Heavenly Father,

Thank You for the words You spoke to Your servant Jeremiah—and for the truth they speak to us today.

Before we were formed, You knew us. Before we doubted ourselves, You called us.

Help us to trust not in our own strength, but in Your presence and power.

Give us courage to say, “Here I am,” even when we feel unprepared.
Put Your words in our mouths. Guide our steps. Walk with us as we walk in obedience.

In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray,

Amen.</I>
