## Scripture Reading  
**Psalm 50:17 (Septuagint)**

<sup class="verse-num">17</sup> A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit, a broken and humbled heart God will not despise.

## Devotional Reflection

***In a world that values strength, polish, and performance, Scripture offers a quieter—and far more demanding—invitation.***

The psalmist does not present God with accomplishments, promises, or religious display. He comes wounded. Honest. Undone. And this, Scripture tells us, is the offering God receives as holy.

A broken heart has no room for pretense.  
A humbled spirit carries no illusions of control.

This is not despair—it is clarity. It is the moment when we stop defending ourselves and allow God to meet us where we truly are. Here, prayer is no longer about sounding righteous. It becomes an act of surrender.

This is the prayer of the heart:  
not eloquent,  
not impressive,  
but true.

And God does not despise it.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord,  
We offer You not our strength, but our need.  
Not polished prayers, but the cry of a humbled heart.  
Create in us a clean heart.  
Renew a right spirit within us.  
Receive this offering—imperfect, but honest.  
Draw near to us in mercy.*

*Amen.*
