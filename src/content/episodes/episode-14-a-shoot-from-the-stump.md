## Scripture Reading

Isaiah 11:1–5
(Septuagint)


<sup class="verse-num">1</sup>And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall grow up out of his root.

<sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And the Spirit of God shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and godliness.

<sup class="verse-num">3</sup>The spirit of the fear of God shall fill him; he shall not judge according to appearance, nor reprove according to report:

<sup class="verse-num">4</sup> but he shall judge the cause of the lowly, and shall reprove the lowly of the earth with equity…

<sup class="verse-num">5</sup>And righteousness shall be his girdle, and truth the girdle of his reins.


## Devotional Reflection

As we sit in the garden, consider:

<b><i>Where in my life does something feel cut down or unfinished?
Am I willing to trust God to bring new life from what remains?
What quiet growth might God be nurturing beneath the surface?</i></b>

The stump is not the end of the story.
The garden is not abandoned.
And God is still bringing life—right on time.



## Closing Prayer

<i>Heavenly Father,

When our lives feel cut back and our hope feels small, remind us that You are the God who brings life from the stump. Thank You for the quiet work You do beneath the surface, long before anything is visible.

Teach us to wait with trust, to hope with patience, and to believe that You are still growing something good—even now.

May our lives bear the fruit of righteousness and truth, rooted deeply in You.

In the name of Jesus, we pray.

Amen.</i>
