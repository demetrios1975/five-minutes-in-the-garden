summary: "Sometimes what we fail to do carries just as much weight as what we actively choose. In Matthew 25, Jesus describes a final judgment—not based on dramatic evil, but on overlooked compassion. It’s a sobering reminder that neglect has consequences."

## Scripture Reading

<sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

<sup class="verse-num">42</sup> For I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:

<sup class="verse-num">43</sup> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.”

<sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Then shall they also answer him, saying, “Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?”

<sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Then shall he answer them, saying, “Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.”

<sup class="verse-num">46</sup> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

## Devotional Reading

Take inventory today—not of the sins you’ve committed, but of the opportunities you’ve ignored.

- **Where have you walked past suffering?**
- **Who needed your attention that you didn’t notice?**
- **Is there someone hungry for encouragement, someone lonely who could use your presence, someone struggling under a weight you could help lift?**

The path of salvation is not just about avoiding sin.  
It’s about being alive to love. To see the need and respond.

## Closing Prayer

*Lord Jesus Christ,  
Awaken my heart from spiritual apathy.  
Forgive me for the many times I have seen and not acted, heard and not responded.  
Open my eyes to the needs around me.  
Give me the courage to move, the compassion to serve, and the joy of being Your hands and feet in the world.  
Amen.*
