      <p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty,<br />
      Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.</p>

      <p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God,<br />
      begotten of the Father before all ages;<br />
      Light of Light, true God of true God;<br />
      begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father,<br />
      by whom all things were made.</p>

      <p>Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven<br />
      and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary<br />
      and became man.</p>

      <p>He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate,<br />
      and He suffered and was buried.</p>

      <p>On the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures.</p>

      <p>He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>

      <p>He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead.<br />
      His kingdom shall have no end.</p>

      <p>And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life,<br />
      who proceeds from the Father,<br />
      who together with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified,<br />
      who spoke through the prophets.</p>

      <p>In one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.</p>

      <p>I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins.</p>

      <p>I expect the resurrection of the dead<br />
      and the life of the ages to come.</p>

      <p class="amen">Amen.</p>
